** UPDATE 1.# TO 2.# ***

Between Orthello versions 1.# and 2.# , 2 major changes have been implemented that
have to be taken into account when upgrading your projects.

* Local positioning

--> SET YOUR 'FOLDER' EMPTIES TO TRANSFORM.POSITION (0,0,0)

In version 2.0 of Orthello, local positioning has been implemented. This means that the 
sprite.position is no longer in world coordinates but in local coordinates (parent related).
They are still world coordinates when the object is located in the root or if the position of
the parent object is at Vector(0,0).

Problems can occur when using empty game objects as containers that are not located at (0,0).
Previously your sprites would be correctly world-positioned but now you have to set the 
empty's position to (0,0) to correctly set world positions for your sprites.

The win is that you can now use parent/child relations between sprites.

* Orthello rect format is now Cartesian

--> REWRITE YOUR SPRITE.RECT or OT.VIEW.WORLDRECT CODE

Previously the different rects you encountered in Orthello like OT.view.worldRect, sprite.rect 
and worldbounds etc... had the format ( left, top, width, -1 * height ). We changed this to
reflect the normal Cartesian system .. so ( left, bottom, width, height ).

You can encounter problems if you worked with those rects in your code.
